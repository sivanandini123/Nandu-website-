<h1 align="left">Introduction:</h1>
<p>The software Development Life Cycle process is a series of steps or phases that are followed to develop a software product.<br>
	   It is a structured framework that outlines the steps for planning, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining high-quality software. <br>
It does this by dividing the software development process into phases: planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase has its own goal and deliverables</p><br>

<h2><ol><b>*SDLC involves 7 phases from start to finish:</b></h2>
<li>Reqirement gathering</li>
<li>Designing</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Maintanance</li>
</ol>
<h3>*Here are the explanation of each phases:</h3>

<h3><li><u>Requirements Analysis:</u></h3>
<p>This phase focuses on gathering what the user wants from the system and documenting it.</p></li>
	  
<h3><li><u>Designing:</u></h3>
<p>Here, the technical team uses the requirements to create system architecture and design.</p></li>
	  
<h3><li><u>Implementation :</u></h3>
<p>Now developers write the code based on the design documents.</p></li>

<h3><li><u>Coding :</u></h3>
<p> Coding is similar to implemntation the developers write the code based on the design documents.</p></li>

<h3><li><u>Testing :</u></h3>
<p>Before releasing the software, it must be tested to find and fix bugs.</p></li>

<h3><li><u>Deployment :</u></h3>
<p>Once the software passes testing, it's released to users.</p></li>

<h3><li><u>Maintanance :</u></h3>
<p>After deployment, the software needs to be monitored, updated, and improved.</p></li>

<h2 align="left">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications efficiently and effectively. It ensures a systematic approach to building software, reducing risks, managing resources, and maintaining quality.<br>

Choosing the right SDLC model—such as Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, or DevOps—is crucial because it aligns the development process with project goals, timelines, team capabilities, and customer requirements. For instance, Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility and continuous feedback, while Waterfall suits projects with well-defined requirements from the start.<br>

Overall, SDLC provides clarity, improves planning and communication, and helps deliver high-quality software on time and within budget. Selecting the appropriate model enhances productivity, minimizes errors, and ensures better client satisfaction.</p>
